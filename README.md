# Sitecore.CustomizedWidgets
Customized Sitecore User Controls By Adding, Removing, Sorting, and Customizing them.

A challenging task that I implemented on a Sitecore project.
In the home page of this project, there are many widgets (around sixteen) like calendar, vacancies, banner, carousel, links, promotions, etc. Each user is able to sort these widgets on the home page and change the size of these widgets using drag and drop.  Also the user is able to add and remove any widget that he/she want. Please see the following images, and see how is the user is able to change the widgets (sort, add, remove)
